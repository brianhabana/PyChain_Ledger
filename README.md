# PyChain Ledger

This is a streamlit web application that is a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [streamlit](https://streamlit.io) - Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. 
All in Python. All for free. No front‑end experience required

* [hashlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) - This module implements a common interface to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) - pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.

* [dataclass](https://realpython.com/python-data-classes/) - One new and exciting feature coming in Python 3.7 is the data class. A data class is a class typically containing mainly data, although there aren’t really any restrictions.
